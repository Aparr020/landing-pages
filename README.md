# RotoWire PPC Landing Pages
This the code that powers our PPC landing pages on TryRotowire.com.

## Why a separate site?
Because Google tags our site as being associated with gambling and often blocks our ads from appearing on that basis -- with no real recourse.

The hope is that by sending people to a more focused, standalone site without that kind of content we'll avoid the constant issues we're running into.

## About the tech
This a Vue 3 app with Vue Router 4 -- powered by Vite.
